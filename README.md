# Slide Kinect

With **Slide Kinect** you can controll the *PowerPoint* slides with your hands and your *Kinect*.

With its intutive interface, you can easily switch between slides and activate the cursor mode. Thanks to its infrared camera the light conditions will not be a problem.

As you can see below, the camera can detect both hands and track them to do the corresponding action.
